description: This is not classic ragù bolognese recipe but a different version. The ragu sauce with veggies is without tomatoes ad it is very easy to prepare. It’s good with pasta specially with tagliatelle. In this recipe I used a special kind of tagliatelle called “paglia e fieno”. They are tasty and both green (because of spinachos) and yellow (because of eggs). Are you ready to cook with me? Let’s start
